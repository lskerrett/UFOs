# UFOs

## Description of the project:
In this project, we create a dynamic website to reference UFOs sightings. To enhance users experience, we used java script and created table to listed all the sightings' information such as date, city, description. We also add filters on all these details. 

## Recommendations to improve webitse:
To improve even more user experience, we could include maps (using Google API for exemple) with the UFO path connections. We could aslo create a community so users can share information.
